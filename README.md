## Developing
### Installing and running PayButton locally
- [Install and configure Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Clone the repo and go to the repo directory
- Copy `config/example-config.json` to `paybutton-config.json`
- Create a `.env.local` file with the environment variables:
  + `PRICE_API_TOKEN="<COINDANCE_API_KEY>"`
  + `WS_AUTH_KEY="<RANDOMLY_GENERATED_UUID>"`
  + `MASTER_SECRET_KEY="<RANDOMLY_GENERATED_UUID>"`
  + `SIDESHIFT_SECRET_KEY="<SIDESHIFT_SECRET_KEY>"` (necessary only when working with the paybutton client for SideShift integration)

- Run the following make command* to build/pull the relevant docker images and run the server locally:


    ```
    make dev
    ```
	_*If you run docker as root, run the command above with `sudo`_

- App will be available at http://localhost:3000.
- Local changes on source code should trigger a reload immediately.

### Yarn docker commands
When developing, there are some commands are meant to be run inside the docker container. To make this process easier, many of them can be run in the host machine with `yarn docker [command]`. Running `yarn docker` will show all of them:

```
Available commands:

  ss, serverstop              [paybutton-dev]     stop WS server
  sr, serverrestart           [paybutton-dev]     restart WS server
```

**WARNING**: Notice this means that many commands are **not supposed** to work by running then purely on the host machine.

For example, `yarn test` runs the `test` script, but this won't work properly when executed from the host machine, so the proper way to execute tests are to run them with `yarn docker test` (or manually entering the `paybutton-dev` container and running `yarn test` there, which is exactly what `yarn docker test` does).

### Make commands
The project includes several Make commands to manage Docker containers and development workflow:

#### Docker management
- `make dev` - Start development environment with Docker Compose
- `make stop-dev` - Stop development containers
- `make reset-dev` - Stop and restart development environment
- `make reset-dev-keep-db` - Restart only the paybutton-dev container (keeps database)
- `make dev-from-dump` - Start development environment using database dump

#### Production
- `make prod` - Start production environment
- `make stop-prod` - Stop production containers  
- `make reset-prod` - Stop and restart production environment
- `make deploy` - Pull latest code and reset production environment

#### Logs
- `make logs-dev` - Follow logs for the development container
- `make logs-db` - Follow logs for the database container
- `make logs-cache` - Follow logs for the Redis cache container
- `make logs-users` - Follow logs for the users service container

#### Testing and linting
- `make lint` - Run ESLint on the codebase
- `make lint-master` - Run ESLint on files changed from master branch
- `make no-isolated-tests` - Check for isolated tests (describe.only/it.only)
- `make github-test-unit` - Run unit tests (GitHub CI only)
- `make github-test-integration` - Run integration tests (GitHub CI only)

- For production, set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in `.env.local.` This optimizes the build for performance and skips the setup of various dev tools (like LiveReload).
